# project-standards

The standards every project follows regardless of language, and the automation
that keeps projects in line with them. The design is in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)
and the vocabulary in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).

## What a project gets

- **Shared checks:** formatting, build, vet, lint and known vulnerabilities
  (Go), Markdown, spelling, secrets and commit messages, all Go tools pinned in
  [`ci/tools.go`](ci/tools.go).
- **Generated tool configs:** `.golangci.yaml`, `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`,
  `.gitleaks.toml` and `.commitlint.yaml`, written from the base configs in
  [`templates/base/`](templates/base/) merged with the project's overrides,
  and for a Go project of kind cli a `.goreleaser.yaml` that builds its
  `name` from its `entrypoint`'s directory, or `cmd/<name>`. Don't edit them;
  edit `mklv.config.json`.
- **One CI/CD workflow:** [`cicd.yaml`](.github/workflows/cicd.yaml) checks,
  releases and deploys every project, chosen by its languages and `kind`.
- **Hooks:** the base [`lefthook.jsonc`](lefthook.jsonc) runs the full check on
  every commit and lints the commit message.
- **Conformance:** a weekly workflow keeps the standard files current in every
  project with the `mklv-conform` topic.

## Using it

### Go projects

Import the `ci` package from the project's magefiles:

```go
//go:build mage

package main

import (
 //mage:import ci
 "github.com/dmikalova/project-standards/ci"
)

func init() {
 // Optional: extra build steps and 100% coverage areas.
 ci.ExtraBuilds = nil
 ci.CoverGates = nil
}
```

Validate locally with `mage ci:fix && mage ci:check`.

### Other projects

Install the binary (dotfiles does this):

```bash
GOBIN=~/.local/bin go install github.com/dmikalova/project-standards/cmd/project-standards@latest
```

Validate locally with `project-standards fix && project-standards check`.

### Every project

- `lefthook.jsonc` includes the base config:

  ```jsonc
  {
    "remotes": [
      {
        "configs": ["lefthook.jsonc"],
        "git_url": "https://github.com/dmikalova/project-standards",
        "ref": "main",
        "refetch": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Run `lefthook install` after cloning.

- `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml` calls
  `dmikalova/project-standards/.github/workflows/cicd.yaml@main`.
- `mklv.config.json` is optional. It declares the `kind` (cli, cloudrun, library
  or infra), deploy settings, tool overrides and ignore-file additions; see
  [`schema/mklv.config.schema.json`](schema/mklv.config.schema.json).

`project-standards conform` writes all of these from the templates, and the
weekly conformance workflow runs it for opted-in projects.

## Database schema deployment

Cloud Run projects with `db/schema.hcl` use Atlas by default. A project can
select Ptah Compat and supply HCL variables in `mklv.config.json`:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "tool": "ptah",
    "vars": { "app_role": "tasks-role" }
  }
}
```

The reusable workflow pins the Ptah release and archive SHA-256. It installs
`ptah-compat` as `atlas`, keeping the existing command interface. Ptah previews
HCL through `schema apply --dry-run` and applies the same schema without a dev
database. Atlas keeps its existing `schema diff` and dev-database path.
Variable assignments are CSV-encoded for both CLIs, preserving commas, quotes,
and line breaks. Preview and apply receive the same variables and retain
the existing guard that stops deployment on destructive schema changes.
Project callers stay generated; do not edit `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml` to
select the database tool.
